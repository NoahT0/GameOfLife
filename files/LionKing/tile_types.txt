Counseling
Welcome to the land of enrichment - when landing on this tile, your Stamina, Strength, and Wisdom Points increase by 300, and you get to choose an advisor from the available list of advisors. If you already have an advisor, you can switch your advisor out for a different one from the list or keep your original advisor. Don’t forget - an advisor can protect you from random events that negatively impact your Pride Points.
